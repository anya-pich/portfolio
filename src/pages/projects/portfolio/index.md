## Design inspiration

[The School of Life](www.theschooloflife.com)

### Colors

Color palette adapted from [thenordics.com](https://www.thenordics.com/tool/color-nordic-yellow)

Because Nordic values resonate with me! Here's some from the same website:

- Openness and a belief in everyone's right to express their opinions.
- Trust in each other and also, because of proximity to power, trust in leaders in society.
- New ways of thinking, focusing, creativity and innovations.
- Sustainable management og the environment and development of natural resources.
- Compassion, tolerance, and conviction about equal value of all people.
